##  cloud-concepts ##

Saas - software as a service
  e.g: Gmail, Google workforce, salesforce,
PaaS - Platform as a service
  e.g: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Herohu,
IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
  e.g: AWS, Azure, GCP,
On-Prem - manage local data center
  e.g: Local Data Center

## shared-responsibility-model ##
M - Microsoft, C - customer, S - Shared

responsibility always retained by the customer:
                                            SaaS PaaS IaaS On-Prem
  1. Information and data                    C    C    C    C        
  2. Devices                                 C    C    C    C
  3. Account and identites                   C    C    C    C

responsibility varies type:
                                            SaaS PaaS IaaS On-Prem
  1. Identity and directory infrastracture   S    S    C    C
  2. Applications                            M    S    C    C
  3. Network control                         M    S    C    C
  4. Operating System                        M    M    M    C

responsibility transfers to cloud providers 
                                            SaaS PaaS IaaS On-Prem
  1. Physical hosts                         M    M    M    C
  2. Physical network                       M    M    M    C
  3. Physical datacenter                    M    M    M    C


datacenter will have its own:
- networking
- power supply
- devices -> CPUs, Memory, STAN, Firewalls, switches, Storages.

to bring datacenter to be available global for less latency,
there are big players AWS, Azure, GCP. multiple locations are tightly coupled
with which we can achieve response in micro seconds, this serves a classic example of IaaS

- companies prefer multi-cloud and hybrid service providers
