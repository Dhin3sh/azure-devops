public-ip

physical networking:
LAN -> Local-area-network
NIC -> network-interface-card
Router+Modem -> single device
switches - for diff. connections to other people.
combination of such switches form LAN, various combinations of such LANs form WAN

public ips are not fixed provided by ISP(InternetServiceProvider) dynamically allocated
private or permanent ips are not free and shall be obtained from ISPs

10.0.0.0/16 - 65534 private-ips

each device will have a private-ip allocated to it without which no communication is possible
since we have a large range, we will be wasting large number if ips so need to break them into small ranges
subnetting - practice of dividing a larger n/w into smaller groups, this increases routing efficiency and network-security
            reduce the broadcast size.
      10.0.1.0/24 - 255 private-ips
