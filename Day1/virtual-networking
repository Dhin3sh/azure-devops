## virtual-networking ##

subnetting
subnet-masking
ip
public-ip

physical networking:
LAN -> Local-area-network
NIC -> network-interface-card
Router+Modem -> single device
switches - for diff. connections to other people.
combination of such switches form LAN, various combinations of such LANs form WAN

public ips are not fixed provided by ISP(InternetServiceProvider) dynamically allocated
private or permanent ips are not free and shall be obtained from ISPs

10.0.0.0/16 - 65534 private-ips

each device will have a private-ip allocated to it without which no communication is possible
since we have a large range, we will be wasting large number if ips so need to break them into small ranges
subnetting - practice of dividing a larger n/w into smaller groups, this increases routing efficiency and network-security
            reduce the broadcast size.
      10.0.1.0/24 - 255 private-ips

Azure VNet:
            fundamental building block for our private n/w in Azure
            vnet enables many types of Azure VMs to securely communicate with each other and on-prem n/w
                        communicate with op-prem resources:
                                    point-to-site VPN
                                    site-to-site VPN
                                    Azure ExpressRoute
                        Communicate between Azure resources:
                                    Through a virtual network
                                    Through a virtual network service endpoint
                                    through vnet peering
                        Filter network traffic:
                                    NSG/ASG
                                    NVA
                        Route network traffic
                                    reoute tables
            Filter network traffic:
                        filter network traffic bw subnets using NSG/ASG or network virtual appliances

 - representation of cloud network
 - hybrid scenarios
 - dedicated instances
 - conectivity between azure services

there are 3 classes in subnets
class A - 10.x.x.x
class B - 172.x.x.x
class C - 192.x.x.x

network-security-group(NSG) - minimal security feature enabled to our network this filters network traffic
filter traffic, Association, evaluation, Rule set.
 - only exposed port will be allowed
 - can be assigned to multiple services(subnet layer, nic, so on.,)
 - properties:
