## ASG ##

Application security group enables you to configure network security, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.
  - ASGs can be set as source or destination on an NSG
  - NSGs would still be required if the VMs are grouped together with ASGs
ASGs -> logical grouping of VMs
